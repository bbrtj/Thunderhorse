This is Thunderhorse - a web framework written using PAGI, which is
asynchronous Perl variation of PSGI. It is based on Gears, which is a separate
project implementing basic concepts of a web framework.

Base code file is in `lib/Thunderhorse.pm`. All Perl namespaces are located
under the same directory. Project is based on perl 5.40 and `Mooish::Base`,
which is a convenience module for importing Moo, Type::Tiny and
Mooish::AttributeBuilder all at once. Proper syntax can be copied from other
project files, like Thunderhorse::App.

All tests are in `t` directory and are based on `Test2::V1`. Tests use subtests
with descriptive names, containing "should" word. If tests need extra packages,
they are to be declared inline in the test code using block form `package {}`.
If package is reusable, it may be moved to t/lib directory.

When adding more code or documentation to the project, always strictly stick to
existing coding standards by copying style found in other files. Do not waste
time looking for files if they are not found in the first search. When the user
instructions are to fix a problem with generated code, always assume the code
has been changed and read it before writing.

If needed, context about PAGI, Gears or Mooish::AttributeBuilder can be
acquired using the perldoc tool, but don't overuse it.
